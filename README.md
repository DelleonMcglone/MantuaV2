The AI-powered programmable liquidity layer on Base

**Mantua Protocol**
*The AI-native operating system for programmable liquidity.*

Mantua is an onchain assistant that lets you interact with DeFi protocols using natural language. Built on Base and powered by Uniswap v4 Hooks, it enables anyone to create and manage advanced liquidity strategies—like dynamic fees or MEV protection—without writing a single line of code.

Just type what you want to do:

* “Swap 1 ETH to USDC with lowest fees”
* “Create a pool with a dynamic fee hook”
* “Analyze my LP performance”
* “Deploy a new token on Base”

Under the hood, Mantua translates natural language into onchain actions using real-time blockchain access, hook-based logic, and AI reasoning. It’s an operating system for programmable liquidity, designed for LPs, traders, and developers who want superpowers.
